# Stadium_ticket_management
This is the first part of my final high school project.

The Ticketing System module is designed to manage ticket sales and event attendance within the stadium. It provides a comprehensive platform that handles real-time seat availability, secure transaction processing, and sales reporting, ensuring efficient and reliable ticketing operations.

Key Features:

Sales Terminal Integration:
Seamlessly integrates with POS devices, allowing for quick and secure ticket purchases at various kiosks.

Real-Time Ticket Management:
Displays current seat availability and ticket status, enabling staff to monitor sales and manage inventory dynamically.

Secure Transactions:
Implements robust data validation and authentication mechanisms to protect against fraudulent activities during ticket sales.

Reporting and Analytics:
Generates detailed reports on ticket sales, revenue, and attendance metrics, providing valuable insights for event management.

Interoperability:
Integrates with the overall stadium network infrastructure (segmented via VLANs) to ensure that ticketing data is shared efficiently with other modules, such as event management and security systems.

Technologies Used:

Development Platform:
Developed in C# using the .NET Framework for a robust and scalable desktop application.

Database:
Utilizes Microsoft SQL Server for secure storage and efficient retrieval of ticket and event data.

Network Integration:
Simulated network infrastructure is modeled in Cisco Packet Tracer, utilizing VLAN segmentation and router-on-a-stick configurations to isolate and manage traffic between the ticketing system, office, and other stadium modules.

Purpose:
The module aims to streamline the ticketing process, reduce transaction times, and provide real-time insights into event attendance and revenue. Future enhancements may include mobile ticketing and contactless payment integration to further improve the user experience.
